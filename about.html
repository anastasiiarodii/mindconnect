                Mental health has become one of the most pressing issues facing post-secondary students in Ontario. 
                According to the Higher Education Quality Council of Ontario (HEQCO), more than half of Ontario's 
                postsecondary students report experiencing significant stress or anxiety.

                        <li>
                            <strong>🔍 Don't Know Where to Start</strong>
                            <p>Multiple websites, phone numbers, and services—it's overwhelming to figure out 
                            which resource is right for them.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>⏰ Long Wait Times</strong>
                            <p>Average wait time is 3+ weeks for counseling. When you're in crisis, 
                            three weeks feels like forever.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>

                            <p>Most services only operate during business hours (9am-5pm), which conflicts

                            <p>Many students feel embarrassed or afraid to seek help, worried about 
                            being judged or misunderstood.</p>
                        </li>

                            <p>Off-campus therapy can cost $150-250 per session, which most students

                            <p>After an initial appointment, many students don't know how to continue 
                            treatment or track their progress.</p>

                            <p>There simply aren't enough counselors. The recommended ratio is 1 counselor

                <p>
                    All of these solutions are <strong>valuable and necessary</strong>. The problem isn't that 
                    they don't work—it's that they're <strong>disconnected from each other</strong> and 
                    <strong>hard for students to access</strong>.

                <p class="highlight-text">
                    What's missing is a <strong>central hub</strong> that connects all these resources, 
                    makes them easy to find, and helps students choose the right support for their needs.
